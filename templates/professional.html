                    <p>I work as a data scientist for electronRx Ltd, a start-up based in Cambridge, UK. We are working on remote healthcare solutions for chronic lung diseases; a challenging arena but one with enormously rewarding results. I am always very happy to discuss any non-proprietary aspects of my work and the field of healthcare technology. </p>

                        I finished my PhD in 2022. My field was Nuclear Physics and Medical Imaging, using image processing and data mining techniques alongside physics modelling to improve the use of ML with PET images. You can read more about it in my thesis, available <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/assessing-the-robustness-of-radiomics-features-in-oncology-pet">here</a>.

                        After working heavily in the Google Cloud infrastructure in the last couple of years, I recently became Google Cloud Certified as a Professional Machine Learning Engineer. I'm experienced and adept in model building and model serving in the cloud, and while much of my work to date is proprietary and as such unsuitable for sharing here, I'm always happy to share my experiences, thoughts and knowledge on request.
